# Noho Webdive

This is the static landing page for noho.webdive.co built on HTML5 Boilerplate in Spring of 2013.

It may be viewed at [noho.webdive.co](http://noho.webdive.co).

It is assumed that bower and grunt are operational on your system and that their commands are available wherever in your file system you happen to find yourself.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nohowebdive/nohowebdive.git
cd nohowebdive
npm install && bower install
```

Then when you're ready to work, run:

`grunt`

And you will be both rocking and rolling.
